Next, you'll dive into the basics of chess from a programmer's perspective: understanding the board, piece movements, legal moves, and how they're represented in code using notations like FEN and PGN.\n\nOnce the foundations are set, you\u2019ll build a command-line based chess engine where a human can play against the bot. You'll begin with a basic random-move bot, then gradually enhance it using evaluation functions that count material and favor stronger positions. The course then dives into real AI logic, implementing the Minimax algorithm and optimizing it with Alpha Beta Pruning to make your bot smarter and more competitive.\n\nFor those interested in visual interfaces, the course includes an optional GUI section using pygame or tkinter, allowing you to add drag and drop functionality and display the chessboard visually. You'll also learn how to connect your bot to online platforms like Lichess using their API, enabling it to play games in real time on the internet.\n\nThe course concludes with a final project where you'll customize your bot\u2019s strategy and personality, whether defensive, aggressive, or balanced, and test it against both human players and other bots.

The course also emphasizes stakeholder engagement, real data analysis, and sustainability-centered thinking. \n\nFinal Deliverables\n1. Waste Audit Report: A detailed report on the data collected during their audit, including\ninsights and recommendations for improvement.\n2. Policy Proposal: A policy document that includes the waste type chosen, the identified\nproblem, and the proposed policy solution.\n3. Waste Management Infrastructure Design: A visual model of their proposed waste\nsegregation system, with an evaluation of its potential impact.\n4. Reflection: A personal reflection (1 page) on the course, what they learned, and how\nthey would apply this knowledge to improve sustainability on campus\n\n\u25cf Live Sessions: These are common for all students during Weeks 1 to 4. After Week 1,\nstudents will focus on their chosen waste type, with tailored tasks to deepen their\nunderstanding and policy design in that area.\n\u25cf Personal Choice: In Week 2 and beyond, students select which waste type they want to\nfocus on (wet, dry, e-waste, biomedical).
