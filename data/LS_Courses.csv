You'll learn to simulate control systems and implement classical PID controllers, understanding how to tune them using methods like Ziegler-Nichols and trial-and-error in a visual modeling environment. The week also introduces the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) — a state-space-based optimal controller — giving you a deeper perspective on modern control techniques. You'll compare PID and LQR in terms of design philosophy, performance, and application.","Here, theory meets application. Using the simulated model of a self-balancing bot (inverted pendulum on wheels), you'll apply the controllers designed in Week 2 to stabilize the system. This involves identifying system dynamics, designing appropriate feedback loops, and fine-tuning controller parameters to keep the bot upright. You'll gain hands-on experience tackling real-world challenges like noise, disturbance rejection, and control signal saturation.","In the final week, you'll extend the functionality of the stabilized bot to include movement and steering. This includes designing control logic for smooth forward, backward, and turning motions while maintaining balance. You'll also work on refining your system’s response to varying setpoints and potentially integrating higher-level command inputs. By the end of the week, you'll have a fully simulated, controllable self-balancing robot built from the ground up.",N/A

The Sports and Skills Summer School,4,41,Analyzing the Impact of IPL Player Performance on Salaries using Machine Learning,Institute Sports Council,"Ever wondered how to avoid a ₹27 Crore mistake like LSG did?
Want to make sure your future IPL team doesn’t end up burning crores on underperformers, here’s your chance to crack the code of predicting player salaries based on performance – and learn how to bid smart at the auction table!
Don't miss out – this is where data meets cricket, and crores are either made or lost.","Course Overview:
The IPL auction is a high-stakes battlefield where crores are spent in minutes. But what separates a smart bid from a ₹27 crore mistake (yes, we’re looking at you, LSG)? This course is designed to help you decode the science behind auction dynamics, understand performance metrics, and build predictive models to estimate player salaries — so you can bid like a pro, not just a fan.

#What You'll Learn:
1) Fundamentals of Performance Analytics: Learn what stats truly matter – batting averages, strike rates, economy, consistency metrics, match context, and more.
2) Building Predictive Models: Dive into machine learning and regression techniques to forecast a player’s value using historical data.
3) Decoding Auction Strategy: Understand team compositions, auction behavior, role scarcity, and how hype impacts pricing.
4) Case Study: The ₹27 Crore Gamble: Deep-dive into Lucknow Super Giants’ investment in Rishabh Pant – analyzing the expectations, performance, and data behind the debate.
5) Market Value vs. Intrinsic Value: Learn how to spot undervalued gems and avoid overpriced traps.

By targeting actions such as a snatch in weightlifting, a volleyball spike, a tennis serve, a golf swing, or a baseball pitch, the system analyzes video footage to extract body pose data using pose estimation tools like OpenPose, MediaPipe, or DeepLabCut. From this data, it calculates key biomechanical metrics such as joint angles, body alignment, timing, and symmetry. These features are then compared to expert performance models or biomechanical standards to generate an efficiency or accuracy rating. The goal is to provide athletes and coaches with objective, data-driven feedback that can be used to improve performance, reduce injury risk, and monitor technique over time.

This short, engaging course teaches you how to build your own chess-playing bot from scratch! Learn the basics of Python, chess logic, game engines, and AI decision-making all while having fun. The necessary theory, and lots of hands-on coding, strategy, and real results on the board.","This Chess Bot Coding Course takes you from beginner to builder as you create your own fully functional chess-playing AI. The course starts with a simple setup process: installing Python, VS Code, and the python-chess library, while introducing you to what a chess bot is and where it's used in the real world. Next, you'll dive into the basics of chess from a programmer's perspective: understanding the board, piece movements, legal moves, and how they're represented in code using notations like FEN and PGN.

Once the foundations are set, you’ll build a command-line based chess engine where a human can play against the bot. You'll begin with a basic random-move bot, then gradually enhance it using evaluation functions that count material and favor stronger positions. The course then dives into real AI logic, implementing the Minimax algorithm and optimizing it with Alpha Beta Pruning to make your bot smarter and more competitive.

For those interested in visual interfaces, the course includes an optional GUI section using pygame or tkinter, allowing you to add drag and drop functionality and display the chessboard visually. You'll also learn how to connect your bot to online platforms like Lichess using their API, enabling it to play games in real time on the internet.

The course concludes with a final project where you'll customize your bot’s strategy and personality, whether defensive, aggressive, or balanced, and test it against both human players and other bots.
